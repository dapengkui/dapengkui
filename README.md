- 👋 Hi, I’m @dapengkui,Working on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau,Here is an altitude of 3800, learning is not easy, load forward.
- 👀 I'm interested in making money, but I'm just a grassroots researcher.
- 🌱 I am learning the basic knowledge of GEE, with the purpose of doing some research on ecological changes in the Three-River Headwaters area.
- 💞️ Usually like to see the big guy's code and video, through the interpretation of the code to improve their ability of GEE.If only some big shot would let me get something for nothing,haw-haw~
